# CarlosNN

Old CNN made in college, does binary classification on Carlos/Not Carlos. Extended to also produce a class activation mapping (heat map) for the classification. The class activation could be used in object localization. The general idea of this project when I was in school was to use a camera to localize Carlos (my dog) in an image. 

This is the code I had archived from my old GitHub account. I haven't yet tested it or rebuilt it, I'm not sure if it works with any of the changes to tensorflow or keras. 

## Example

Here is a sample image run through the classifier, with the class activation mapping extracted and colorized.
